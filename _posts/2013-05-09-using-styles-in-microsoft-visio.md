If you want to use Visio to create complex diagrams with a consistent look, you'll definitely want to use styles. Visio

In addition to the *Style* and *Define Styles* commands in on the *Format* menu mentioned in the document, you may also
want to check out the *Drawing Explorer Window* command in the *View* menu. The latter gives you an overview of the
defined styles and their relationships.
