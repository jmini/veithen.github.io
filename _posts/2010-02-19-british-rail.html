<blockquote>
<p>
We think, with hindsight, that the complete separation of track and train into separate businesses at the time of
privatisation was not right for our railways. We think that the separation has helped push up the cost of running the
railways - and hence fares - and is now slowing decisions about capacity improvements. Too many people and organisations
are now involved in getting things done - so nothing happens. As a result, the industry lacks clarity about who is in
charge and accountable for decisions.
