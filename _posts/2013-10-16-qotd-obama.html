 Obama: "The United States of America is prepared to use all elements of our power, including military force, to secure
 our core interests in the region. We will confront external aggression against our allies and partners, as we did in
 the Gulf War. We will ensure the free flow of energy from the region to the world. Although America is steadily
 reducing our own dependence on imported oil, the world still depends on the region’s energy supply, and a severe
 disruption could destabilize the entire global economy."
