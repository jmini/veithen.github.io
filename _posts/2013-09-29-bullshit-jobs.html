In the high-frequency trading business, billions of dollars are spent on high-speed lines, programming talent, and
advanced computers by funds looking to capitalize on the smallest and most fleeting of mispricings. Those are computing
resources and insanely intelligent people who could instead be put to work making the Internet run faster for everyone,
or figuring out how to distribute electricity more efficiently, or really anything other than trying to figure out how
to trade gold futures on the latest Fed announcement faster than the speed of light.
