<blockquote>
<p>
By means of ever more effective methods of mind-manipulation, the democracies will change their nature; the quaint old
forms -- elections, parliaments, Supreme Courts and all the rest -- will remain. The underlying substance will be a new
kind of non-violent totalitarianism. All the traditional names, all the hallowed slogans will remain exactly what they
were in the good old days. Democracy and freedom will be the theme of every broadcast and editorial [...]. Meanwhile the
ruling oligarchy and its highly trained elite of soldiers, policemen, thought-manufacturers and mind-manipulators will
quietly run the show as they see fit.
