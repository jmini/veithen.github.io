Recently I got into a [discussion][1] with somebody from IBM about an issue in [Axiom][2]. I argued that the proposed
solution is only a workaround and that I would prefer a clean solution that addresses the root cause and fixes the issue
once and for all. In his reply the guy from IBM carefully avoided the word *workaround*, and instead used
*tactical solution*. I really like that euphemism.

So, next time you report to your boss, don't speak about workarounds and proper fixes, but about tactical and
strategical solutions. He will be impressed...
